# üåø Flora App Implementation Tasks

This document is the canonical implementation guide for Flora.  
It breaks down the roadmap into actionable steps, with **acceptance criteria** and **UI snippets** that define the intended look & feel.  
Use these snippets directly when building ‚Äî they are Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui compatible.

---

## üîß Visual Baseline (Tokens & Rules)

**Theme tokens (Tailwind v4, HSL vars in `globals.css`):**
```
--background, --foreground, --card, --card-foreground
--primary, --primary-foreground
--secondary, --secondary-foreground
--muted, --muted-foreground
--accent, --accent-foreground
--destructive, --destructive-foreground
--border, --input, --ring, --radius
```

**UI rules:**
- Containers: `max-w-lg` for forms, `max-w-6xl` for dashboards
- Corners: `rounded-2xl` for cards, `rounded-md` for inputs/buttons
- Motion: subtle hover opacity/translate, no heavy parallax
- A11y: visible `focus-visible:ring-2 ring-ring ring-offset-2`

## 10. Performance & UX Hygiene
- [x] SSR page shells with suspense for data
- [x] Cache weather and debounce species search
 - [x] Apply optimistic updates and ensure accessibility standards

---

## 11. Key Routes & APIs
- `/today`, `/plants`, `/plants/new`, `/plants/[id]`, `/dashboard`

---

## 12. Definition of Done
